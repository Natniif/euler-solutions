# Euler solutions

List of my solutions from [Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) Website

I did these all from the time of early 2022 to summer of 2022. Some of the solutions might be a bit wacky since this was my first time using python (or any programming language) to solve problems which  exceeded the complexity of `print("Hello World!")`. I thought I might share these anyways since they could help someone taking on project euler for the first time as well.
